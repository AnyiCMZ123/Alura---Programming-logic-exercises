**1.- Target shooting** 

It's a simple game in JavaScript using the HTML "canvas" element. The game consists of shooting at a target that appears on the screen. Although it can be considered a simple game, it is useful to practice and understand some basic concepts of programming logic and JavaScript programming.

**2.- Draw** 

This code also uses the HTML canvas element along with JavaScript to create a user interaction. In this case, the code allows the user to click on the canvas and draws pink circles at the clicked locations.

**3.- Pincel** 

This code is very similar to the "Draw" code, it also uses the HTML canvas element in combination with JavaScript to create a user interaction. The code allows the user to draw blue circles while holding down the mouse button and moving over the canvas.
